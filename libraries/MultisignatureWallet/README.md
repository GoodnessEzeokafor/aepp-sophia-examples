Multisignature (multi-signature) is a digital signature scheme which allows a group of users to sign a single document. Usually, a multisignature algorithm produces a joint signature that is more compact than a collection of distinct signatures from all users. Multisignature can be considered as generalization of both group and ring signatures. Multisignature (often called multisig) is a form of technology used to add additional security for cryptocurrency transactions. Multisignature addresses require another user or users sign a transaction before it can be broadcast onto the blockchain. The required number of signatures is agreed at the start once people agree to create the address.
