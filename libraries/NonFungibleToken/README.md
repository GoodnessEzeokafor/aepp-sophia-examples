A non-fungible token (NFT) is a special type of cryptographic token which represents something unique; non-fungible tokens are thus not interchangeable. Non-fungible tokens are used to create verifiable digital scarcity. NFTs are used in several specific applications that require unique digital items like crypto-collectibles and crypto-gaming. Popular blockchain games like CryptoKitties make use of non-fungible tokens. NFTs are used to represent in-game assets, which are in control of the user instead of the game developer. NFTs also find potential use in digital art, by helping prove authenticity and ownership.
